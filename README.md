# Modulation Recognition using CNN

This is a repo forked from [here](https://github.com/radioML/examples). 
I extracted the runnable python code from original Jupyter notebook so
I can evaluate its performance on platforms other than Intel x86.

## Pre-request

Python 3
Tensorflow
RML Dataset (downloadable [here](https://www.deepsig.io/datasets/))

## Usage

    python rml2016_example.py
